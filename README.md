# Sourcegraph: Code Intelligence for teams

Sourcegraph is a **Git repository service** with Code Intelligence. You
can [use Sourcegraph on Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/join) for free.

Sourcegraph gives your team the power to build better software with:

* **Code Intelligence:** Understand code more quickly with language-aware jump-to-definition and tooltips. (Go and Java only, more languages coming soon.)
* **Live usage examples:** See how any function, class, etc., is currently being used across your codebases. As a wise developer once said, "The right example is worth a thousand words of documentation."
* **Smart search:** Find code quickly by function name, full text, etc.
* **Deep integrations:** Works great with GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and more.
* **Hackable source code:** [Sourcegraph's source code](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) is publicly available under the [Fair Source License](https://fair.io).

## Under the hood

Sourcegraph is built on several components:

* [srclib](https://srclib.org), a multi-language, hackable source code
  analysis toolchain
* The [Go](http://golang.org) programming language
* [gRPC](http://grpc.io), an HTTP2-based RPC protocol that uses
  Protocol Buffer service definitions
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a JavaScript library for
  building UIs.
* [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com), a public instance of
  Sourcegraph that provides information about open-source projects to
  your local Sourcegraph.
