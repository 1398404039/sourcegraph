# Until https://github.com/prettier/prettier/commit/5c6b93a65425291a87f932d8eb9f5a114875d7af is
# in the prettier release version we use, disable prettier on these files. The editor extension
# doesn't autoformat them because they are jsonc not json, so the editor and CLI prettier would
# be out of sync.
