# Running this sample language server with vscode

1. Build `sample_server` and install it into your `$PATH`: `go install`.
1. Follow the [instructions to install and run the vscode-client extension](../vscode-client/README.md).
1. In Visual Studio Code with the vscode-client extension installed, create a new text file and type some text. Move your mouse cursor over the text, and you should see "Hello over LSP!" in a tooltip. Right click on any text and click "Go to Definition", and you'll be taken to the beginning of the file. Right click on any text and click "Find All References", and if your text is longer than 6 characters, you'll be shown two references in the first line of your file.
