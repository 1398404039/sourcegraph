# To avoid the warning:
#
#     Unknown ctags kind: foo
#
# Make sure that all ctags kinds in that file
# are handled in ctagsKindToLSPSymbolKind in
# cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/search_symbols.go

# After changing that file, run a dev server and check for any other warnings
# from the symbols service.

# When you want to add a parser, make a file in that directory with
# .ctags as suffix.
