# Integrating existing developer tools with Sourcegraph

| Audience | <div style="font-weight:normal;text-align:left !important">Other companies that make products for developers</div> |
| --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Explain how they can increase usage inside their existing customers by integrating with Sourcegraph |

All products for developers need to:

- **Be in the developer workflow:** Every developer at your customers uses your product, and they can't get their job done without it.
- **Win the hearts and minds of developers:** If your product were taken away from developers, they would notice and complain immediately.
