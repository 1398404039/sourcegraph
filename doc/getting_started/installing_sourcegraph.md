# Installing Sourcegraph (WIP)

Once Sourcegraph is deployed, the installation process takes only a few minutes. This screencast shows the typical steps involved for installing and configuring a private, self-hosted Sourcegraph instance, ready for sharing internally.

It uses GitHub as the code host, but the steps are largely the same for other code hosts, the only major difference being that GitLab and Bitbucket Server provide native code intelligence integrations.
