# How to use the handbook

<!-- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/ -->

## Links

If you ask a question and someone answers with a link to the handbook, they are doing so because the handbook has the best canonical answer for your question. They may also be proud that the answer is documented. It doesn't mean you shouldn't have asked the question or that you should've memorized the entire handbook (nobody has memorized the entire handbook).
