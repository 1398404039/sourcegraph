## Meetings

### Internal meetings

- Always start on time, even if some participants are late. (And try not to be late.) Latecomers can watch the Zoom recording.
  - If the meeting's leader is not present at the precise start time (and hasn't proactively mentioned they are late), everyone should leave the call and switch to other work. This is a nudge to respect others' time and to not be late to meetings you lead.
- Always end on time (or early).
  - If there's more to discuss, handle it asynchronously or schedule a new meeting with the appropriate participants.
  - A meeting that would run over is a nudge that the meeting's agenda or duration was wrong, or that the meeting was led ineffectively.

### External meetings

- Join meetings early or on time.
- End meetings on time.
- Be patient for external folks who are running late to our meetings.
  - For customers, prospects, and users, wait on the line for at least 10 minutes (and send them a friendly reminder after 3-5 minutes).
