# Changelog

All notable changes to Sourcegraph Server and Data Center are documented in this file.

## Unreleased Changes

### Changed

* `gitMaxConcurrentClones` now also limits the concurrency of updates to repos in addition to the initial clone.
* In the GraphQL API, `site.users` has been renamed to `users`, `site.orgs` has been renamed to `organizations`, and `site.repositories` has been renamed to `repositories`.
* An authentication provider must be set in site configuration (see [authentication provider documentation](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/config/authentication). Previously the server defaulted to builtin auth if none was set.
* If a process dies inside the Sourcegraph container the whole container will shutdown. We suggest operators configure a [Docker Restart Policy](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/#restart-policy-details) or a [Kubernetes Restart Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy). Previously the container would operate in a degraded mode if a process died.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where Index Search status page failed to render.
* User data on the site admin Analytics page is now paginated, filterable by a user's recent activity, and searchable.
* The link to the root of a repo in the bread crumbs now preserves the revision you are at.
* When using the `http-header` auth provider, signin/signup/signout links are now hidden.
* Repository paths beginning with `go/` are no longer reservered by Sourcegraph.
* Interpret `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP header when `httpToHttpsRedirect` is enabled.

### Removed

* The `ssoUserHeader` site config property (deprecated since January 2018) has been removed. The functionality was moved to the `http-header` authentication provider.

### Added

* The new repository contributors page (linked from the repository homepage) displays the top Git commit authors in a repository, with filtering options.
* Custom langservers in the site config may now specify a `metadata` property containing things like homepage/docs/issues URLs for the language server project, as well as whether or not the language server should be considered experimental (not ready for prime-time). This `metadata` will be displayed in the UI to better communicate the status of a language server project.
* Access tokens now have scopes (which define the set of operations they permit). All access tokens still provide full control of all resources associated with the user account (the `user:all` scope, which is now explicitly displayed).
* The new access token scope `site-admin:sudo` allows the holder to perform any action as any other user. Only site admins may create this token.
* Links to Sourcegraph's changelog have been added to the site admin Updates page and update alert.
* If the site configuration is invalid or uses deprecated properties, a global alert will be shown to all site admins.
* Added disclaimer to blob code intelligence status indicator when running an `experimental` language server.

## 2.7.6

### Fixed

* If a user's account is deleted, session cookies for that user are no longer considered valid.

## 2.7.5

### Changed

* In Sourcegraph Data Center, RBAC is now used by default. Most Kubernetes clusters require it. See the Data Center installation instructions for more information (including disabling if needed).
* Increased git ssh connection timeout to 30s from 7s.
* Phabricator integration no longer requires staging areas though [it is still suggested](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/features/phabricator-extension#staging-areas).

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where langservers that were not enabled would display the "Restart" button in the Code Intelligence management panel.
* Fixed an issue where the "Update" button in the Code Intelligence management panel would be displayed inconsistently.
* Fixed an issue where toggling a dynamic search scope would not also remove `@rev` (if specified)
* Fixed an issue where in the webui where modes that can only be determined by the full filename (not just the file extension) of a path weren't supported (Dockerfiles are the first example of this).
* Fixed an issue where the graphiql console failed when variables are specified.
* In Sourcegraph Data Center, Indexed Search no longer maintains its own git clones. This significantly reduces disk size requirements for the indexed-search pod.
* (Sourcegraph Server) Fixed an issue where language server Docker containers would not be automatically restarted if they crashed.
* Fixed an issue where if the first user on a site authenticated via SSO, the site would remain stuck in uninitialized mode.

### Added

* More detailed progress information is displayed on pages that are waiting for repositories to clone.
* Admins can now see charts illustrating daily, weekly, and monthly uniqueÂ user counts by visiting the site-admin Analytics page.
* Admins can now host and see results from Sourcegraph user satisfaction surveys locally by setting the `"experimentalFeatures": { "hostSurveysLocally": "enabled"}` site config option. This feature will be enabled for all instances once stable.
* Access tokens are now supported for all authentication providers (including OpenID and SAML, which were previously not supported).
* The new `motd` setting (in global, organization, and user settings) displays specified messages at the top of all pages.
* Site admins may now view all access tokens site-wide (for all users) and revoke tokens from the new access tokens page in the site admin area.

## 2.7.0

### Changed

* Missing repositories no longer appear as search results. Instead, a count of repositories that were not found is displayed above the search results. Hovering over the count will reveal the names of the missing repositories.
* "Show more" on the search results page will now reveal results that have already been fetched (if such results exist) without needing to do a new query.
* The bottom panel (on a file) now shows more tabs, including docstrings, multiple definitions, references (as before), external references grouped by repository, implementations (if supported by the language server), and file history.
* The repository sidebar file tree is much faster on massive repositories (200,000+ files)

### Fixed

* In Sourcegraph Data Center, searches no longer block if the index is unavailable (e.g. after the index pod restarts). Instead, it respects the normal search timeout and reports the situation to the user if the index is not yet available.
* Repository results are no longer returned for filters that are not supported (e.g. if `file:` is part of the search query)
* Fixed an issue where file tree elements may be scrolled out of view on page load.
* Fixed an issue that caused "Could not ensure repository updated" log messages when trying to update a large number of repositories from gitolite.
* When using an HTTP authentication proxy (`"auth.provider": "http-header"`), usernames are now properly normalized (special characters including `.` replaced with `-`). This fixes an issue preventing users from signing in if their username contained these special characters.
* Fixed an issue where the site-admin Updates page would incorrectly report that update checking was turned off when `telemetryDisabled` was set, even as it continued to report new updates.
* `repo:` filters that match multiple repositories and contain a revision specifier now correctly return partial results even if some of the matching repositories don't have a matching revision.
* Removed hardcoded list of supported languages for code intelligence. Any language can work now and support is determined from the server response.
* Fixed an issue where modifying `config.json` on disk would not correctly mark the server as needing a restart.
* Fixed an issue where certain diff searches (with very sparse matches in a repository's history) would incorrectly report no results found.
* Fixed an issue where the `langservers` field in the site-configuration didn't require both the `language` and `address` field to be specified for each entry

### Added

* Users (and site admins) may now create and manage access tokens to authenticate API clients. The site config `auth.disableAccessTokens` disables this new feature. Access tokens are currently only supported when using the `builtin` and `http-header` authentication providers (not OpenID or SAML).
* User and site admin management capabilities for user email addresses are improved.
* The user and organization management UI has been greatly improved. Site admins may now administer all organizations (even those they aren't a member of) and may edit profile info and configuration for all users.
* If SSO is enabled (via OpenID or SAML) and the SSO system provides user avatar images and/or display names, those are now used by Sourcegraph.
* Enable new search timeout behavior by setting `"experimentalFeatures": { "searchTimeoutParameter": "enabled"}` in your site config.
  * Adds a new `timeout:` parameter to customize the timeout for searches. It defaults to 10s and may not be set higher than 1m.
  * The value of the `timeout:` parameter is a string that can be parsed by [time.Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) (e.g. "100ms", "2s").
  * When `timeout:` is not provided, search optimizes for retuning results as soon as possible and will include slower kinds of results (e.g. symbols) only if they are found quickly.
  * When `timeout:` is provided, all result kinds are given the full timeout to complete.
* A new user settings tokens page was added that allows users to obtain a token that they can use to authenticate to the Sourcegraph API.
* Code intelligence indexes are now built for all repositories in the background, regardless of whether or not they are visited directly by a user.
* Language servers are now automatically enabled when visiting a repository. For example, visiting a Go repository will now automatically download and run the relevant Docker container for Go code intelligence.
  * This change only affects Sourcegraph Server users, not Data Center users.
  * You will need to use the new `docker run` command at https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/server/ in order for this feature to be enabled. Otherwise, you will receive errors in the log about `/var/run/docker.sock` and things will work just as they did before. See https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/code-intelligence/install for more information.
* The site admin Analytics page will now display the number of "Code Intelligence" actions each user has made, including hovers, jump to definitions, and find references, on the Sourcegraph webapp or in a code host integration or extension.
* An experimental cross repository jump to definition which consults the OSS index on Sourcegraph.com. This is disabled by default; use `"experimentalFeatures": { "jumpToDefOSSIndex": "enabled" }` in your site configuration to enable it.
* Users can now view Git branches, tags, and commits, and compare Git branches and revisions on Sourcegraph. (The code host icon in the header takes you to the commit on the code host.)
* A new admin panel allows you to view and manage language servers. For Server users, it allows you to enable/disable/update/restart language servers at the click of a button. For Data Center users, it shows the current status of language servers.
* Users can now tweet their feedback about Sourcegraph when clicking on the feedback smiley located in the navbar and filling out a Twitter feedback form.
* A new button in the repository header toggles on/off the Git history panel for the current file.

## 2.6.8

### Bug fixes

* Searches of `type:repo` now work correctly with "Show more" and the `max` parameter.
* Fixes an issue where the server would crash if the DB was not available upon startup.

## 2.6.7

### Added

* The duration that the frontend waits for the PostgreSQL database to become available is now configurable with the `DB_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` env var (the value is any valid Go duration string).
* Dynamic search filters now suggest exclusions of Go test files, vendored files and node_modules files.

## 2.6.6

### Added

* Authentication to Bitbucket Server using username-password credentials is now supported (in the `bitbucketServer` site config `username`/`password` options), for servers running Bitbucket Server version 2.4 and older (which don't support personal access tokens).

## 2.6.5

### Added

* The externally accessible URL path `/healthz` performs a basic application health check, returning HTTP 200 on success and HTTP 500 on failure.

### Behavior changes

* Read-only forks on GitHub are no longer synced by default. If you want to add a readonly fork, navigate directly to the repository page on Sourcegraph to add it (e.g. https://sourcegraph.mycompany.internal/github.com/owner/repo). This prevents your repositories list from being cluttered with a large number of private forks of a private repository that you have access to. One notable example is https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine.
* SAML cookies now expire after 90 days. The previous behavior was every 1 hour, which was unintentionally low.

## 2.6.4

### Added

* Improve search timeout error messages
* Performance improvements for searching regular expressions that do not start with a literal.

## 2.6.3

### Bug fixes

* Symbol results are now only returned for searches that contain `type:symbol`

## 2.6.2

### Added

* More detailed logging to help diagnose errors with third-party authentication providers.
* Anchors (such as `#my-section`) in rendered Markdown files are now supported.
* Instrumentation section for admins. For each service we expose pprof, prometheus metrics and traces.

### Bug fixes

* Applies a 1s timeout to symbol search if invoked without specifying `type:` to not block plain text results. No change of behaviour if `type:symbol` is given explicitly.
* Only show line wrap toggle for code-view-rendered files.

## 2.6.1

### Bug fixes

* Fixes a bug where typing in the search query field would modify the expanded state of file search results.
* Fixes a bug where new logins via OpenID Connect would fail with the error `SSO error: ID Token verification failed`.

## 2.6.0

### Added

* Support for [Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server) as a codehost. Configure via the `bitbucketServer` site config field.
* Prometheus gauges for git clone queue depth (`src_gitserver_clone_queue`) and git ls-remote queue depth (`src_gitserver_lsremote_queue`).
* Slack notifications for saved searches may now be added for individual users (not just organizations).
* The new search filter `lang:` filters results by programming language (example: `foo lang:go` or `foo -lang:clojure`).
* Dynamic filters: filters generated from your search results to help refine your results.
* Search queries that consist only of `file:` now show files whose path matches the filters (instead of no results).
* Sourcegraph now automatically detects basic `$GOPATH` configurations found in `.envrc` files in the root of repositories.
* You can now configure the effective `$GOPATH`s of a repository by adding a `.sourcegraph/config.json` file to your repository with the contents `{"go": {"GOPATH": ["mygopath"]}}`.
* A new `"blacklistGoGet": ["mydomain.org,myseconddomain.com"]` offers users a quick escape hatch in the event that Sourcegraph is making unwanted `go get` or `git clone` requests to their website due to incorrectly-configured monorepos. Most users will never use this option.
* Search suggestions and results now include symbol results. The new filter `type:symbol` causes only symbol results to be shown.
  Additionally, symbols for a repository can be browsed in the new symbols sidebar.
* You can now expand and collapse all items on a search results page or selectively expand and collapse individual items.

### Configuration changes

* Reduced the `gitMaxConcurrentClones` site config option's default value from 100 to 5, to help prevent too many concurrent clones from causing issues on code hosts.
* Changes to some site configuration options are now automatically detected and no longer require a server restart. After hitting Save in the UI, you will be informed if a server restart is required, per usual.
* Saved search notifications are now only sent to the owner of a saved search (all of an organization's members for an organization-level saved search, or a single user for a user-level saved search). The `notifyUsers` and `notifyOrganizations` properties underneath `search.savedQueries` have been removed.
* Slack webhook URLs are now defined in user/organization JSON settings, not on the organization profile page. Previously defined organization Slack webhook URLs are automatically migrated to the organization's JSON settings.
* The "unlimited" value for `maxReposToSearch` is now `-1` instead of `0`, and `0` now means to use the default.
* `auth.provider` must be set (`builtin`, `openidconnect`, `saml`, `http-header`, etc.) to configure an authentication provider. Previously you could just set the detailed configuration property (`"auth.openIDConnect": {...}`, etc.) and it would implicitly enable that authentication provider.
* The `autoRepoAdd` site configuration property was removed. Site admins can add repositories via site configuration.

### Bug fixes

* Only cross reference index enabled repositories.
* Fixed an issue where search would return results with empty file contents for matches in submodules with indexing enabled. Searching over submodules is not supported yet, so these (empty) results have been removed.
* Fixed an issue where match highlighting would be incorrect on lines that contained multibyte characters.
* Fixed an issue where search suggestions would always link to master (and 404) even if the file only existed on a branch. Now suggestions always link to the revision that is being searched over.
* Fixed an issue where all file and repository links on the search results page (for all search results types) would always link to master branch, even if the results only existed in another branch. Now search results links always link to the revision that is being searched over.
* The first user to sign up for a (not-yet-initialized) server is made the site admin, even if they signed up using SSO. Previously if the first user signed up using SSO, they would not be a site admin and no site admin could be created.
* Fixed an issue where our code intelligence archive cache (in `lsp-proxy`) would not evict items from the disk. This would lead to disks running out of free space.

## 2.5.16, 2.5.17

* Version bump to keep Data Center and Server versions in sync.

## 2.5.15

### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue where Sourcegraph Data Center would incorrectly show "An update is available".
* Fixed Phabricator links to repositories
* Searches over a single repository are now less likely to immediately time out the first time they are searched.
* Fixed a bug where `auth.provider == "http-header"` would incorrectly require builtin authentication / block site access when `auth.public == "false"`.

### Phabricator Integration Changes

We now display a "View on Phabricator" link rather than a "View on other code host" link if you are using Phabricator and hosting on Github or another code host with a UI. Commit links also will point to Phabricator.

### Improvements to SAML authentication

You may now optionally provide the SAML Identity Provider metadata XML file contents directly, with the `auth.saml` `identityProviderMetadata` site configuration property. (Previously, you needed to specify the URL where that XML file was available; that is still possible and is more common.) The new option is useful for organizations whose SAML metadata is not web-accessible or while testing SAML metadata configuration changes.

## 2.5.13

### Improvements to builtin authentication

When using `auth.provider == "builtin"`, two new important changes mean that a Sourcegraph server will be locked down and only accessible to users who are invited by an admin user (previously, we advised users to place their own auth proxy in front of Sourcegraph servers).

1.  When `auth.provider == "builtin"` Sourcegraph will now by default require an admin to invite users instead of allowing anyone who can visit the site to sign up. Set `auth.allowSignup == true` to retain the old behavior of allowing anyone who can access the site to signup.
2.  When `auth.provider == "builtin"`, Sourcegraph will now respects a new `auth.public` site configuration option (default value: `false`). When `auth.public == false`, Sourcegraph will not allow anyone to access the site unless they have an account and are signed in.

## 2.4.3

### Added

* Code Intelligence support
* Custom links to code hosts with the `links:` config options in `repos.list`

### Changed

* Search by file path enabled by default

## 2.4.2

### Added

* Repository settings mirror/cloning diagnostics page

### Changed

* Repositories added from GitHub are no longer enabled by default. The site admin UI for enabling/disabling repositories is improved.

## 2.4.0

### Added

* Search files by name by including `type:path` in a search query
* Global alerts for configuration-needed and cloning-in-progress
* Better list interfaces for repositories, users, organizations, and threads
* Users can change their own password in settings
* Repository groups can now be specified in settings by site admins, organizations, and users. Then `repogroup:foo` in a search query will search over only those repositories specified for the `foo` repository group.

### Changed

* Server log messages are much quieter by default

## 2.3.11

### Added

* Added site admin updates page and update checking
* Added site admin telemetry page

### Changed

* Enhanced site admin panel
* Changed repo- and SSO-related site config property names to be consistent, updated documentation

## 2.3.10

### Added

* Online site configuration editing and reloading

### Changed

* Site admins are now configured in the site admin area instead of in the `adminUsernames` config key or `ADMIN_USERNAMES` env var. Users specified in those deprecated configs will be designated as site admins in the database upon server startup until those configs are removed in a future release.

## 2.3.9

### Fixed

* An issue that prevented creation and deletion of saved queries

## 2.3.8

### Added

* Built-in authentication: you can now sign up without an SSO provider.
* Faster default branch code search via indexing.

### Fixed

* Many performance improvements to search.
* Much log spam has been eliminated.

### Changed

* We optionally read `SOURCEGRAPH_CONFIG` from `$DATA_DIR/config.json`.
* SSH key required to clone repositories from GitHub Enterprise when using a self-signed certificate.

## 0.3 - 13 December 2017

The last version without a CHANGELOG.
