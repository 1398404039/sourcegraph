# vendor forks

This file lists all forked repositories that are vendored
under their original names. (For multi-package dependencies, it is
easier to keep a fork at the same import path than to rewrite the
import paths.)

* gopkg.in/gorp.v1: github.com/sourcegraph/gorp branch `v1`
* github.com/NYTimes/gziphandler: using gzip.BestSpeed for ~1.8x speedup in many HTTP API endpoints
