/**
 * generateLSPSessionIfNeeded generates a unique, difficult-to-guess

 *
 * Sessions with a nonempty session key can perform text edits (e.g.,
 * textDocument/didChange), so we must set it if document text will
 * ever need to change from what's in the Git commit specified in the
 * workspace root URI. Currently this is only needed for when Zap is
 * enabled.
 *
 * ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ SECURITY: Anyone with this session key (and access to the
 * repository that this LSP session is for) can read the contents of
 * all files in the workspace and modify file contents in a way that
 * could lead to the user committing those modified contents (e.g., if
 * the user was in a live Zap session and then ran `git commit -a`
 * locally).
